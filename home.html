				<h2>FlipIt</h2>
				<p>
					FlipIt is a simple game that models cybersecurity in its contemporary form as an
					ongoing territorial battle. It is the game of "stealthy takeover".<br/>

				<h2>Computational science by doing</h2>
				<p>
					This course allows students to write their first scientific paper by tackling a
					real research problem in a team supervised by a professor and senior PhD
					students. Research is conducted by applying mathematical and computational
					techniques learnt during other courses and by exploring and by learning new
					theoretical tools as needed.<br/>
					At the beginning of the course, we expose to students a panel of mathematical
					and computational challenges. Students form groups and each group selects a
					challenge. The challenge is researched (under supervision) and theoretical
					solutions are proposed and debated. Solutions are analyzed and coded.
				<p>
					Results are structured (in English) and formatted as a “professional” research
					paper that can be submitted to a peer-reviewed conference (or even a journal).
					40% of the papers written by students during this course are indeed accepted by
					international conferences (after being reviewed by program committees of
					scientific conferences).<br/>
					Publications are frequently co-authored with experimented researchers who
					integrate the models, theory and programs written by the students in larger
					research endeavors. To date, students co-signed papers with researchers
					affiliated with Telecom ParisTech, Ecole des mines de Saint Etienne, Samsung
					Research, Altis Semiconductor, Université de Bucarest, Ingenico, Technische
					Universität Darmstadt, University of Bristol etc.
